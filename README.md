# UFOs
Module 11 of UofT Data Analytics Boot Camp


## Project Overview
To develop a web page that displays the UFOs sighting information.
The web page should contain the dynamic table of sighting data with filters for Date, City, State, Country and Shape of UFO(s) observed.

## Resources
* Software: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Lab
* Programming Language: JavaScript
* Web Design: HTML, Bootstrap 4, CSS
* Data Source: data.js

## Further Development
* Sighting Input Page: I would create an additional page where user can enter the date, location and additional comments of UFO sighting. 
* User Chatting Room: Input page could also contain a chatting function for users to interact.
* Link to MongoDB and Live Data: I would use Web Scraping to gather the live data and store the data to MongoDB. This way, the web application will always contain the latest information. The Input Page mentioned above should also be stored in the MongoDB.
